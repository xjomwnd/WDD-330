<h1>An Introduction to Functions, Execution Context and the Call Stack</h1>
<p>The Execution Context is an abstract environment created by JS to execute code.</p>
<P>What is the Execution Context?</P>
<P>When the JavaScript engine scans a script file, it makes an environment called the<strong>Execution Context</strong> that handles the entire transformation and execution of the code.</P>
<P>During the context runtime, the parser parses the source code and allocates memory for the variables and functions. The source code is generated and gets executed.</P> 
</strong>The Execution Stack is used to execute functions and keep track of all the Execution Context created.</p> 

<p>There are two types of execution contexts: <strong>Global</strong> and <strong>Function</strong>.</p>
<h3>Global</h3> 
<p>The global execution context is created when a JavaScript script first starts to run, and it represents the global scope in JavaScript.</p> 
<h3>Function</h3>
<p>A function execution context is created whenever a function is called, representing the function's local scope.</p>
<h2>Phases of the JavaScript Execution Context</h2>
<p>There are two phases of JavaScript execution context:</p>
<li>1.<strong>Creation phase: </strong>In this phase, the JavaScript engine creates the execution context and sets up the script's environment. 
      It determines the values of variables and functions and sets up the scope chain for the execution context.</li>
<li>2.<strong>Execution phase:</strong> In this phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code in the execution context. 
    It processes any statements or expressions in the script and evaluates any function calls.</li>
<p>Everything in JS happens inside this execution context. It is divided into two components. One is memory and the other is code. It is important to remember that these phases and components are applicable to both global and functional execution contexts.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, the JavaScript engine executes the entire source code, 
    creates a global execution context, and then does the following things:</p>
<li>1. Creates a global object that is window in the browser and global in NodeJs.</li>
<li>2. Sets up a memory for storing variables and functions.</li>
<li>3. Stores the variables with values as undefined and function references.</li>
