<h1>An Introduction to Functions, Execution Context and the Call Stack</h1>
<p>The Execution Context is an abstract environment created by JS to execute code.</p> 
</strong>The Execution Stack is used to execute functions and keep track of all the Execution Context created.</p> 
<p>The Execution context is created in two stages, the creation and the execution stage.</p>

<p>There are two types of execution contexts: <strong>global</strong> and <strong>function</strong>.</p>
<h3>Global</h3> 
<p>The global execution context is created when a JavaScript script first starts to run, and it represents the global scope in JavaScript.</p> 
<h3>Function</h3>
<p>A function execution context is created whenever a function is called, representing the function's local scope.</p>
