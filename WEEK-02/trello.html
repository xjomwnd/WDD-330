<h3>Ponder</h3>
    <p>Each team should have made a copy of this Trello board. This is a shared board that you will all be working from over the semester.</p>
   <p>There are some tasks marked "Team" and others that are not. Each week the team should complete the appropriate team activity together. The goal is then to complete one additional card per team member per week. These should be done individually as much as possible, but remember that you have a team to help you if you get stuck on a particular task.</p>
   <p>In order to demonstrate how this should work it is recommended that each member of the team complete the same card for this first time. After this week each member should complete different cards.</p>
   <p>Begin with the "Add item to cart broken" task. This is largely a debugging and troubleshooting task, but it will help you to become familiar with the code we were given.</p>
