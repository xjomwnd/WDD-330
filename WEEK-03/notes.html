        <h1>Introduction User Experience Interface</h1>
        <p>
          User interface (UI) design refers to the aesthetic elements by which people interact with a product, such as buttons, icons, menu bars, typography, colors, and more.
        </p>
        <p> 
          User experience (UX) design refers to the experience a user has when interacting with a product. 
        </p>
        <p>Smartphone adoption and its influence on people’s lives is growing at an exponential rate.
        </p>
        <p>Smartphones have become a go-to source for all sorts of information because they’re easily accessible anytime, anywhere.
        
          Beyond communication and information gathering, services and features such as banking, placing orders, healthcare tracking, and even home security have become part of the smartphone experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          But designing a usable and enjoyable mobile experience is more than just good aesthetics. In order to trigger positive reactions, you have to satisfy the basic usability principles of interface design.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Learnability: How easily first-time users complete basic tasks.</li>
            <li>Efficiency: How quickly users perform basic tasks once they’ve learned the design.</li>
            <li>Memorability: The ability of users to remember how to use the system.</li>
            <li>Errors: The amount and severity of errors users make and how easily they can correct them.</li>
            <li>Satisfaction: How pleasant the experience of using the design was.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Here are 10 tried and tested UX design principles that are key to creating great mobile user experiences.
        </strong></p>
        <h2>10 MOBILE UX DESIGN PRINCIPLES YOU SHOULD KNOW</h2>
        <h2>1. Content Prioritization</h2>
        <p>
          When designing your products, keep interface elements to a minimum. Simple designs are what keep the user engaged and at ease with products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Display only essential content and functionalities the user needs. 
          Secondary content should be available through a menu. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To further reduce clutter, use icons instead of text wherever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prioritize content and remember that notifications for new content should appear without interrupting primary content!
        </p>
        <h2>2. Make Navigation Intuitive</h2>
        <p>
          Learnability of your design is key for its success. Users should intuitively be able to navigate through your app via clear pathways and be able to complete all primary tasks without requiring any explanations.
        </p>
        <p>
          When navigating through your app, the user should always know where they are without wondering how they got there, or what they are to do next. 
        </p>
        <h2>3. Touchscreen Target Sizes</h2>
        <p>
          People interact with touch screens using their fingers, maybe even their toes, but that’s none of our business. The important part is to make interface elements big enough to capture these actions. But how big can you make them with only a small amount of screen space?
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only is the size of the target important, but so is the spacing between targets. If action buttons are too close to each other, you risk the user making undesired actions leading to frustration. It is especially important to space out contradicting action buttons, such as the save and delete buttons to avoid errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Human Interface Guidelines suggest a minimum target size of 44 pixels wide x 44 pixels tall.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Provide User Control</h2>
        <p>
          People like to feel like they’re in control of their actions. So that’s what you need to give them. Allow users to make decisions to personalize their journeys. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When the user needs to know what’s going on, let them know! Integrate status and other types of feedback into your interface without disrupting the user’s workflow.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Legible Text Content</h2>
        <p>
          The key to mobile typography is readability. If users can’t read your content, there’s no point in offering content in the first place. Communicating your designs in a clear, simple layout delivers your message effortlessly.
        </p>
        <p>The strategy for optimal mobile typography is a balance between legibility and space conservation. Generally, anything smaller than 16 pixels (or 11 points) becomes challenging to read for any screen. Adversely, an unnecessarily large font size results in awkward breaks and hyphenation that take longer to read. Hence, tiring the reader.</p>
        <p>
          Spacing and layout are also important to improve legibility. Adding space between text aids the user in reading and creates a feeling that there isn’t so much information to take in.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Make Interface Elements Clearly Visible</h2>
        <p>
          People use their phones everywhere. Indoors, outdoors, in planes, trains, buses, cars, underground, overground (you get it right?), you name it, they’re on their phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s important to have sufficient contrast between content and background in your designs so it’s legible, in any setting, even outside in the sunlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important part in choosing your text and background is to test it out with users.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Hand Position Controls</h2>
        <p>Hand positions should be kept in mind when placing controls on a mobile design.</p>
        <p>Delivering a great mobile UX takes into consideration all different types of users. Keeping in mind right- and left-handedness is also a design feature to consider.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Minimize Data Input</h2>
        <p>Users are always looking for shortcuts and efficient ways to get things done. Help them reduce typing required by shortening forms, removing unnecessary fields and using ‘remember me’ options for future use. Relieve users by providing autocomplete, recent search history and location detection to reduce data entry requirements and accelerate the experience.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Create a Seamless Experience</h2>
        <p>Seamless experiences are invisible. The user doesn’t realize it, but the flow is a natural process and the user feels ‘right’ using it. Functional, flexible, and responsive mobile designs are what users today expect to encounter.
        </p>
        <h2>10. Test Your Design</h2>
        <p>Usability testing is essential for the success of your products. Test different features, layouts and variations of your designs to see what works best. Build your products with a user-centered approach by testing with real users. With each round of testing, you uncover new ways to improve your design to meet your users needs.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In order to keep up with the fast advancements in technology and shift to smartphone adoption, designing mobile experiences needs to implement usability principles. The future of smartphone technologies is peaking in development and users are unforgiving with lagging systems. Delivering extraordinary experiences for users to experience is the way forward.

        <h1>Introduction to web APIs</h1>
        <p>APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Browser APIs</strong> are built into your web browser and are able to expose data from the browser and surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with it.
        For example, the Web Audio API provides JavaScript constructs for manipulating audio in the browser — taking an audio track, altering its volume, applying effects to it, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>Examples of Browser APIs</h3>
        <h4>APIs for manipulating documents</h4>
        <p>APIs for manipulating documents loaded into the browser. The most obvious example is the DOM (Document Object Model) API, which allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS — creating, removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc.
        </p>
        <h4>APIs that fetch data from the server</h4>
        <p>APIs that fetch data from the server to update small sections of a webpage on their own are very commonly used.
        </p>
        <p>The main API used for this is the Fetch API, although older code might still use the XMLHttpRequest API.
        </p>
        <h4>APIs for drawing and manipulating graphics</h4>
        <p>
          For example, you might draw shapes such as rectangles or circles, import an image onto the canvas, and apply a filter to it such as sepia or grayscale using the Canvas API, or create a complex 3D scene with lighting and textures using WebGL.
        </p>
        <h4>Device APIs</h4>
        <p>Device APIs enable you to interact with device hardware: for example, accessing the device GPS to find the user's position using the Geolocation API.
        </p>
        <h4>Client-side storage APIs</h4>
        <p>Client-side storage APIs enable you to store data on the client-side, so you can create an app that will save its state between page loads, and perhaps even work when the device is offline. There are several options available, e.g. simple name/value storage with the Web Storage API, and more complex database storage with the IndexedDB API.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Third-party APIs</strong> are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to retrieve their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example, the Twitter API allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website. It provides a special set of constructs you can use to query the Twitter service and return specific information.
        </p>
        <h3>Examples of Third-party APIs</h3>
        <h4>Twitter API</h4>
        <p>The Twitter API, which allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website.</p>
        <h4>Map APIs</h4>
        <p>Map APIs, like Mapquest and the Google Maps API, which allow you to do all sorts of things with maps on your web pages.</p>
        <h4>Facebook suite of APIs</h4>
        <p>The Facebook suite of APIs, which enables you to use various parts of the Facebook ecosystem to benefit your app, such as by providing app login using Facebook login, accepting in-app payments, rolling out targeted ad campaigns, etc.</p>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <P> <STrong>What exactly API means?</STrong>: API stands for application programming interface, which is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. </P>
        <p> <strong>Which APIs and interfaces (object types) do you need to use while developing your Web app or site?
        </strong>
        </p>
        <p>When writing code for the Web, there are a large number of Web APIs available. Below is a list of all the APIs and interfaces (object types) that you may be able to use while developing your Web app or site.</p>
        </p>

        <h1>Scheduling: setTimeout and setInterval</h1>
        <p>We may decide to execute a function not right now, but at a certain time later. That’s called “scheduling a call”.</p>
        <ul>
        <p>There are two methods for it:</p>
        <li><strong>setTimeout:</strong> allows us to run a function once after the interval of time.</li>
        <li><strong>setInterval:</strong> allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>JavaScript allows you not only to invoke the function right now but also a particular time later. The latter is known as a “scheduling call.”</p>
        <p>setTimeout allows us to run a function once after the interval of time. setInterval allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.
        <p>
          These methods are not a part of JavaScript specification. But most environments have the internal scheduler and provide these methods. In particular, they are supported in all browsers and Node.js.
