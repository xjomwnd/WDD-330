        <h1>Week 09 Notes</h1>
        <h3 class="notes">11 May 2023</h3>
    <h1>Variable scope, closure</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a very function-oriented language. It gives us a lot of freedom. A function can be created at any moment, passed as an argument to another function, and then called from a totally different place of code later.</p>
    <p>We already know that a function can access variables outside of it (“outer” variables).</p>
    <p>But what happens if outer variables change since a function is created? Will the function get newer values or the old ones?</p>
    <p>And what if a function is passed along as an argument and called from another place of code, will it get access to outer variables at the new place?</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, there are 3 ways to declare a variable: let, const (the modern ones), and var (the remnant of the past).</p>

    <h2>Nested functions</h2>
    <p>A function is called “nested” when it is created inside another function.</p>
    <p>It is easily possible to do this with JavaScript.</p>
    <p>We can use it to organize our code, like this:</p>
    <li>function sayHiBye(firstName,lastName) {</li>
    <li>// helper nested function to use below function getFullName() {</li>
    <li>return firstName + " " + lastName; }</li>
    <li>alert( "Hello, " + getFullName() );</li>
    <li>alert( "Bye, " + getFullName() ); }</li>
    <p>Here the nested function getFullName() is made for convenience. It can access the outer variables and so can return the full name. Nested functions are quite common in JavaScript.</p>
    <p>What’s much more interesting, a nested function can be returned: either as a property of a new object or as a result by itself. It can then be used somewhere else. No matter where, it still has access to the same outer variables.</p>
    <p>Below, makeCounter creates the “counter” function that returns the next number on each invocation:</p>
    <li>functionmakeCounter(){</li>
    <li>letcount =0;</li>

    <li>returnfunction(){</li>
    <li>returncount++;};</li>
    <li>}</li>

    <li>letcounter =makeCounter();</li>
    <li>alert(counter());// 0
    </li>
    <li>alert(counter());// 1
    </li>
    <li>alert(counter());// 2
    </li>
    
    <p>Despite being simple, slightly modified variants of that code have practical uses, for instance, as a random number generator to generate random values for automated tests.</p>
    <p>How does this work? If we create multiple counters, will they be independent? What’s going on with the variables here?</p>
    <p>Understanding such things is great for the overall knowledge of JavaScript and beneficial for more complex scenarios. So let’s go a bit in-depth.</p>
    
    <h2>Lexical Environment</h2>
    <p>For clarity, the explanation is split into multiple steps.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 1. Variables</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, every running function, code block {...}, and the script as a whole have an internal (hidden) associated object known as the Lexical Environment.</p>
    <p>The Lexical Environment object consists of two parts:</p>
    <li>1. Environment Record – an object that stores all local variables as its properties (and some other information like the value of this).</li>
    <li>2. A reference to the outer lexical environment, the one associated with the outer code.</li>
    <p><strong>A “variable” is just a property of the special internal object, Environment Record. “To get or change a variable” means “to get or change a property of that object”.</strong></p>

    <p>My three major questions in the week-02 learning are:</p>
<li>1. What is debugging and why is it important? (Answered)</li>
<li>2. What are some common debugging techniques or strategies?</li>
<li>3. How do I debug a specific error or issue in my code?</li>
