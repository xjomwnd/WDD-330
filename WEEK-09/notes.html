        <h3 class="notes">11 May 2023</h3>
    <h1>Variable scope, closure</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a very function-oriented language. It gives us a lot of freedom. A function can be created at any moment, passed as an argument to another function, and then called from a totally different place of code later.</p>
    <p>We already know that a function can access variables outside of it (“outer” variables).</p>
    <p>But what happens if outer variables change since a function is created? Will the function get newer values or the old ones?</p>
    <p>And what if a function is passed along as an argument and called from another place of code, will it get access to outer variables at the new place?</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, there are 3 ways to declare a variable: let, const (the modern ones), and var (the remnant of the past).</p>

    <h2>Nested functions</h2>
    <p>A function is called “nested” when it is created inside another function.</p>
    <p>It is easily possible to do this with JavaScript.</p>
    <p>We can use it to organize our code, like this:</p>
    <li>function sayHiBye(firstName,lastName) {</li>
    <li>// helper nested function to use below function getFullName() {</li>
    <li>return firstName + " " + lastName; }</li>
    <li>alert( "Hello, " + getFullName() );</li>
    <li>alert( "Bye, " + getFullName() ); }</li>
    <p>Here the nested function getFullName() is made for convenience. It can access the outer variables and so can return the full name. Nested functions are quite common in JavaScript.</p>
    <p>What’s much more interesting, a nested function can be returned: either as a property of a new object or as a result by itself. It can then be used somewhere else. No matter where, it still has access to the same outer variables.</p>
    <p>Below, makeCounter creates the “counter” function that returns the next number on each invocation:</p>
    <li>functionmakeCounter(){</li>
    <li>letcount =0;</li>

    <li>returnfunction(){</li>
    <li>returncount++;};</li>
    <li>}</li>

    <li>letcounter =makeCounter();</li>
    <li>alert(counter());// 0
    </li>
    <li>alert(counter());// 1
    </li>
    <li>alert(counter());// 2
    </li>
    
    <p>Despite being simple, slightly modified variants of that code have practical uses, for instance, as a random number generator to generate random values for automated tests.</p>
    <p>How does this work? If we create multiple counters, will they be independent? What’s going on with the variables here?</p>
    <p>Understanding such things is great for the overall knowledge of JavaScript and beneficial for more complex scenarios. So let’s go a bit in-depth.</p>
    
    <h2>Lexical Environment</h2>
    <p>For clarity, the explanation is split into multiple steps.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 1. Variables</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, every running function, code block {...}, and the script as a whole have an internal (hidden) associated object known as the Lexical Environment.</p>
    <p>The Lexical Environment object consists of two parts:</p>
    <li>1. Environment Record – an object that stores all local variables as its properties (and some other information like the value of this).</li>
    <li>2. A reference to the outer lexical environment, the one associated with the outer code.</li>
    <p><strong>A “variable” is just a property of the special internal object, Environment Record. “To get or change a variable” means “to get or change a property of that object”.</strong></p>
       
    <h3>Step 2. Function Declarations</h3>
    <p>A function is also a value, like a variable.</p>
    <p><strong>The difference is that a Function Declaration is instantly fully initialized.</strong></p>
    <p>When a Lexical Environment is created, a Function Declaration immediately becomes a ready-to-use function (unlike let, that is unusable till the declaration).</p>
    <p>That’s why we can use a function, declared as Function Declaration, even before the declaration itself.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 3. Inner and outer Lexical Environment</h3>
    <p>When a function runs, at the beginning of the call, a new Lexical Environment is created automatically to store local variables and parameters of the call.</p>

    <h3>Step 4. Returning a function</h3>
    <p>All functions remember the Lexical Environment in which they were made. Technically, there’s no magic here: all functions have the hidden property named [[Environment]], that keeps the reference to the Lexical Environment where the function was created</p>
    <p><strong>A variable is updated in the Lexical Environment where it lives.</strong></p>

    <h3>Closure</h3>
    <p>There is a general programming term “closure”, that developers generally should know.</p>
    <p>A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them. In some languages, that’s not possible, or a function should be written in a special way to make it happen. But as explained above, in JavaScript, all functions are naturally closures (there is only one exception, to be covered in The "new Function" syntax).
    </p>
    <p>That is: they automatically remember where they were created using a hidden [[Environment]] property, and then their code can access outer variables.</p>
    <p>When on an interview, a frontend developer gets a question about “what’s a closure?”, a valid answer would be a definition of the closure and an explanation that all functions in JavaScript are closures, and maybe a few more words about technical details: the [[Environment]] property and how Lexical Environments work.
    </p>
     
    <h3>Garbage collection</h3>
    <p>Usually, a Lexical Environment is removed from memory with all the variables after the function call finishes. That’s because there are no references to it. As any JavaScript object, it’s only kept in memory while it’s reachable.
    </p>
    <p>However, if there’s a nested function that is still reachable after the end of a function, then it has [[Environment]] property that references the lexical environment.
    </p>
    <p>In that case the Lexical Environment is still reachable even after the completion of the function, so it stays alive.
    </p>
    <p>A Lexical Environment object dies when it becomes unreachable (just like any other object). In other words, it exists only while there’s at least one nested function referencing it.
    </p>

    <h3>Real-life optimizations</h3>
    <p>As we’ve seen, in theory while a function is alive, all outer variables are also retained.
    </p>
    <p>But in practice, JavaScript engines try to optimize that. They analyze variable usage and if it’s obvious from the code that an outer variable is not used – it is removed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>An important side effect in V8 (Chrome, Edge, Opera) is that such variable will become unavailable in debugging.</strong></p>

    <h1>Currying</h1>
    <p>Currying is an advanced technique of working with functions. It’s used not only in JavaScript, but in other languages as well.</p>
     
    <p>More advanced implementations of currying, such as _.curry from lodash library, return a wrapper that allows a function to be called both normally and partially:</p>
    <li>1. function sum(a, b) {</li>
    <li>2. return a + b;</li>
    <li>3. }</li>
    <li>4. </li>
    <li>5. let curriedSum = _.curry(sum); // using _.curry from lodash library</li>
    <li>6. </li>
    <li>7. let curriedSum = _.curry(sum); // using _.curry from lodash library</li>
    <li>8. alert( curriedSum(1)(2) ); // 3, called partially</li>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Currying is a transform that makes f(a,b,c) callable as f(a)(b)(c). JavaScript implementations usually both keep the function callable normally and return the partial if the arguments count is not enough.</p>
    <p>Currying allows us to easily get partials. As we’ve seen in the logging example, after currying the three argument universal function log(date, importance, message) gives us partials when called with one argument (like log(date)) or two arguments (like log(date, importance)).</p>

<p>This however was still not enough. While you could use <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">CSS</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> to animate (and otherwise manipulate) SVG vector images — as they are represented by markup — there was still no way to do the same for bitmap images, and the tools available were rather limited. The Web still had no way to effectively create animations, games, 3D scenes, and other requirements commonly handled by lower level languages such as C++ or Java.</p>
<p>The situation started to improve when browsers began to support the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas"><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></a> element and associated <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas API</a> in 2004. As you'll see below, canvas provides some useful tools for creating 2D animations, games, data visualizations, and other types of applications, especially when combined with some of the other APIs the web platform provides, but can be difficult or impossible to make accessible</p>
<p>The below example shows a simple 2D canvas-based bouncing balls animation that we originally met in our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_building_practice">Introducing JavaScript objects</a> module:</p><iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/bouncing-balls/index-finished.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Around 2006–2007, Mozilla started work on an experimental 3D canvas implementation. This became <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</a>, which gained traction among browser vendors, and was standardized around 2009–2010. WebGL allows you to create real 3D graphics inside your web browser; the below example shows a simple rotating WebGL cube:</p><iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/apis/drawing-graphics/threejs-cube/index.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>This article will focus mainly on 2D canvas, as raw WebGL code is very complex. We will however show how to use a WebGL library to create a 3D scene more easily, and you can find a tutorial covering raw WebGL elsewhere — see <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Getting_started_with_WebGL">Getting started with WebGL</a>.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="active_learning_getting_started_with_a_canvas"><h2 id="active_learning_getting_started_with_a_canvas"><a href="#active_learning_getting_started_with_a_canvas">Active learning: Getting started with a &lt;canvas&gt;</a></h2><div class="section-content"><p>If you want to create a 2D <em>or</em> 3D scene on a web page, you need to start with an HTML <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas"><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></a> element. This element is used to define the area on the page into which the image will be drawn. This is as simple as including the element on the page:</p>
<div class="code-example"><pre class="brush: html notranslate"><code><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>canvas</span> <span class="token attr-name">width</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>320<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">height</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>240<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>canvas</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
