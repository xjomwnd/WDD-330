        <h1>Week 01 Notes: Preparation</h1>
        <h3 class="notes">17 April 2023</h3>
       <p>In this weeks preparation studies I learned about the importance of preparation.</p>
       <h2>Tips</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>Read for understanding, not completion. This means that some weeks when the concepts settle quickly in your mind you will fly through the reading. Other weeks you might have to read several times...and spend lots of time working through the code examples until you understand. You may even need to go find a few extra sources on your own for some topics.</li>
        <li>Don't skip the code examples and exercises! Make sure to spend time reviewing these. In fact a solved exercise can certainly count as notes!</li>
        <li>Take good notes! One of the most important things that you can include in your notes are questions that arise in your mind as you read. Having this list will help you to know what topics need more time, and will give you something to say when the instructor asks: "Do you have any questions from the reading?</li>
        <li>If there's a chapter in the book that's not assigned, it is not because those topics are not important...but often because you are expected to already understand those concepts from a previous course. You may want to read some of those unassigned chapters if the topics look unfamiliar to you.</li>
        <li>There is not a specific list of exercises given because not everyone needs the same thing. This course is designed to give you the flexibility to spend your time in the areas you need, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach where you spend all your time for the week on concepts that you may have already mastered. This approach will frustrate some of you, but becomes very powerful once you adjust to it.</li>
        <li>For example, you might read through the chapter on Functions and maybe the author's explanation left some questions in your mind about arguments. So you do a quick search which turns up this article about How to Use ES6 Arguments and Parameters. Then you visit the list of exercises below and find this list of JavaScript Functions that will give you as much practice as you need writing functions that use arguments and parameters.</li>
        <li>
            Again, don't be afraid to find your own sources! Sometimes the way an author explains a concept will not compute with your brain. Go find another explanation! As a starting point.
            </p>
        </li>
       </ul>
       
        <h1>Week 1 Notes: How To Use ES6 Arguments And Parameters</h1>
        <h3 class="notes">18 April 2023</h3>
        <p>ECMAScript 6 (or ECMAScript 2015) is the newest version of the ECMAScript standard and has remarkably improved parameter handling in JavaScript. We can now use rest parameters, default values and destructuring, among other new features.</p>
       <p>The spread operator not only is easier to use, but packs more features. For example, it can be used multiple times and can be mixed with other arguments in a function call:</p>
       <p>function myFunction() {
        for(var i in arguments){
          console.log(arguments[i]);
        }
      }
      var params = [10, 15];
      myFunction(5, ...params, 20, ...[25]);    // 5 10 15 20 25

      <h1>Javascript Info Notes</h1>
      <h3 class="notes">18 April 2023</h3>
      <p>From the Javascript Info: <a href="https://javascript.info/"
        target="_blank">Javascript Info</a></p>
      <p> I came to learn that the code editors are of two types:
       <strong>IDE and Lightweigt Editors</strong> 
      </p>
      <P>The term IDE (Integrated Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a “whole project.” As the name suggests, it’s not just an editor, but a full-scale “development environment.”
      </P>
      <li>Visual Studio Code (cross-platform, free).</li>
     <li>WebStorm (cross-platform, paid).</li>
      <p>Lightweight editors” are not as powerful as IDEs, but they’re fast, elegant and simple.
        There are many options, for instance:
        </p>
      <li>Sublime Text (cross-platform, shareware).</li>
      <li>Notepad++ (Windows, free).
      </li>
      <li>Vim and Emacs are also cool if you know how to use them.
      </li>
      <h1>Note it! Notes</h1>
      <h3 class="notes">19 April 2023</h3>
     <p>In the week one learning, I also noted the textbooks section and from it, I learned about the note book, "Note it!"
    </p>
    <p>The one question I've is: How do I delete the saved work from this notes editor?</p>

              var aNoteText = document.getElementById("note_editor").value
              var aCompleteNote = currentDateAndTime.toLocaleString() + "--" + aNoteDescription 
              aCompleteNote += "<p>" + aNoteText + "</p>"
        
            var storedNotesString = localStorage.getItem("all_notes")
            var allNotes = JSON.parse(storedNotesString)
            if(allNotes == null){
              allNotes = []
            }
            allNotes.push(aCompleteNote)
            var allNotesString = JSON.stringify(allNotes)
            localStorage.setItem("all_notes",allNotesString)
            showAllNotes()
